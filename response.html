        <p>To write a Python script to print an ASCII art of a cat, you can use multi-line strings to represent the ASCII art. Here is an example code snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="python language-python">cat_art = """
 /\_/\  
( o.o ) 
 &gt; ^ &lt;
"""

print(cat_art)
</code></pre>

<p>Just copy and paste the above code into a Python script file and run it to see the ASCII art of a cat being printed. You can also find various ASCII art generators online to create more complex and detailed ASCII art images.</p>
