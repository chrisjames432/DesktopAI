Sure! Here is the code from the image you provided:

```python
numbers = [3, 5, 2, 8, 4, 10, 1]

for index in range(0, len(numbers) - 1):
    min_index = index
    for j in range(index + 1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[j] < numbers[min_index]:
            min_index = j
    temp = numbers[index]
    numbers[index] = numbers[min_index]
    numbers[min_index] = temp

print(numbers)
```

This code performs a selection sort algorithm on the `numbers` list and prints the sorted list.
