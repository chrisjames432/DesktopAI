To print an ASCII art of a cat in Python, you can use a multi-line string containing the ASCII representation of the cat. Here's an example code snippet for a simple ASCII cat:

```python
cat_ascii = '''
 /\\_/\\
( o.o )
 > ^ <
'''

print(cat_ascii)
```

You can run this script in a Python interpreter or save it in a .py file and execute it to see the ASCII art of a cat. Feel free to customize the ASCII art to your liking!
